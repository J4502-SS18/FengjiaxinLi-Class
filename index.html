    <p>Sitting on the bench or standing at the crossing,
      they hold a sign writing “homeless” or “need help”, even “God bless you”.</p>
    <p>They are strangers, but you are familiar with them. Homeless,
      a group of people are wandering from place to place in the city with a similar sign and different stories.</p>
<br/>
    <p>Rick is the member of this minor group. He has been roaming in Columbia for several years.
    In a gradually colder winter, they still can’t find their homes.</p>

    <p>Rick calls himself John Doe, which is a name from those who are unidentified when dead. </p>
    <p>He refuses to tell his full name.  He sits on the Eighth Street, holding a sign, embedded by his coat from the charity.</p>

    <p>He was born in California in 1984 and grew up as a foster child. He traveled from a family to another family just like he travels from one place to another.</p>
    <p>In his 21, he came to Kansas City. He used to have a job in Columbia, but he was fired. Now, it is the fourth year he has been in this city.</p>

  <p class="pullquote">“I’m not homeless, I’m houseless,” he said, “when I apply for a job, they need me to fill the application, which needs my address. And I don’t have it.”</p>
